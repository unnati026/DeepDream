# Deep Dream with TensorFlow and InceptionV3

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script for implementing the Deep Dream algorithm using TensorFlow and the InceptionV3 model. Deep Dream enhances patterns and features in an input image based on the neural network's recognition, giving it a dream-like quality.

## Customization

- Adjust the `layers_contributions` list to include different layers for the deep dream algorithm.

- Experiment with the `epochs`, `steps_per_epoch`, and `weight` parameters in the `run_gradient_ascent` function for different results.

- Try different input images for diverse deep dream effects.
